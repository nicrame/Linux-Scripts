#### MOTD for EL

This will install colorful and nice motd (message of the day) with some system informations.  
MOTD is generated with scripts, that will be extracted to /etc/profile.d 
where you may modify them to suite your needs.  
fail2ban and docker stats will not be shown if user do not have correct permissions for that.  
Here is the main install script motd-el.sh - and the source files .sh used to create it.

To install use this command:  
> sudo sh -c "wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicrame/Linux-Scripts/master/MOTD-EL/motd-el.sh && chmod +x motd-el.sh && ./motd-el.sh"  

You may also add system administrator email address as argument, like that:  
> sudo sh -c "wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicrame/Linux-Scripts/master/MOTD-EL/motd-el.sh && chmod +x motd-el.sh && ./motd-el.sh admin@email"  

Most of the work is done using scripts published here: https://github.com/yboetz/motd

Some parts inside install script are .sh files encoded with base64. 
The reason was it's much easier to extract such data without formatting problems 
with special characters from one file.  
I know it's lazy, but it is fast and very easy to do.
